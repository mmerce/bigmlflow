BigMLFlow
==========

All the resources generated by the `BigML` API-first platform, including
models, are totally white-box, and they can be downloaded as JSON and used
to predict anywhere.

On the other hand, MLFlow offers tracking and deploying capacities for a
variety of ML models as long a `flavor` is created to define how to log, save
and load those models to be actionable.

The `bigmlflow` library implements this flavor. It uses
`BigML's Python bindings <https://bigml.readthedocs.io/en/latest/local_resources.html>`_
to integrate the BigML models with `MLFlow's` tracking and deploying capacities.

Installation
---------------

This library is available as a PyPI package. To install it, just run:

.. code:: bash

    pip install bigmlflow

The flavor is implemented in a single ``bigmlflow`` module

Flavor methods
--------------

.. automodule:: bigmlflow.bigml
    :members:
    :undoc-members:
    :show-inheritance:

BigMLFlow usage
---------------

Some `examples <https://github.com/bigmlcom/bigmlflow/tree/master/examples>`_
are available in the repository to illustrate how you can use `MLFlow`
to generate `BigML` models, log evaluation metrics and deploy the different
Supervised Models available in the `BigML` platform.


Tests
-----

The `tests` directory contains some tests for the logging, saving and loading
of models.
We use `Pytest` to run the tests, so you can install it separately

.. code:: bash

    pip install pytest

or as an extra for development and testing purposes

.. code:: bash

    pip install -e .[tests]
